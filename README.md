## Commands

### jirarest (REST API)

#### Syntax

```
| jirarest MODE OPTIONS
```

#### Modes

* List favorite filters of the configured user

  ```
  | jirarest filters
  ```

* Run a specific filter and return Issues

  ```
  | jirarest issues FILTER_ID
  ```

* Run a JQL search and return Issues.

  ```
  | jirarest jqlsearch JQL_QUERY
  ```

* Run a JQL search and return the all Changes for all matching Issues.
  
  ```
  | jirarest changelog JQL_QUERY
  ```

* List rapidboards or sprints (Greenhopper REST API)

  ```
  | jirarest rapidboards [list|all|RAPIDBOARD_ID]
  ```

  * list will list all scrum boards. This is the default behavior.
  * all will list all sprints in all scrum boards.
  * RAPIDBOARD_ID will list all sprints in one specific scrum board
    * Hint: to get issues in a sprint use jqlquery "sprint=sprint_id" after you have found the desired sprint id here with rapidboards.

* Pipe search results into a jqlsearch

  ```
  | search ... | eval foo="WTF-1,WTF-2,WTF-3" | makemv delim=, foo | map search="|jirarest batch JQL_QUERY $foo$"
  ```

  * The JQL_QUERY in the batch command is a partial query that ends with the IN keyword, e.g. "key in"
  * Results piped in from the preceding search will populate the IN clause.
  * Results piped in can be comma- or space- separated
  * This is a little ungainly, but quite powerful if you want to pull a list of JIRA keys from an external source and then get all the Issues from JIRA

#### Options

* comments 
  * Shows comments for all Issues returned by main option.
  * Compatible with issues, jqlquery, and batch commands.

* changefield
  * By default, pretty names for fields are show. Changefield outputs internal field names instead.
  * Compatible with issues, jqlquery and batch commands.

* changetime TIME_FIELD
   * Sets _time to the chosen field. If field does not contain a valid, returns 0 Epoch time
   * _time defaults to created if changetime is not set
   * Compatible with issues, jqlquery, and batch commands.

* fields "[INTERNAL_FIELD_NAME,...]"
   * Limits the set of fields returned
   * Takes a comma-separated list of internal field names. No extra spaces, we're too lazy to trim
   * If you want multiple fields, please enclose the field list in double-quotes
   * key and created are always returned

#### Notes

* The rest command can also be called with | jira. 

### jirasoap (SOAP API - deprecated)

#### Syntax

```
| jirasoap MODE OPTIONS
```

#### MODES

* List all filters available to the logged-in user

  ```
  | jirasoap filters
  ```

* Run a filter

  ```
  | jirasoap issues [time=TIME_OPTION] FILTER_ID
  ```

* Run a text search

  ```
  | jirasoap search [time=TIME_OPTION] "foo bar bas"
  ```

* Run a JQL search

  ```
  | jirasoap jqlsearch [time=TIME_OPTION] JQL_QUERY
  ```

#### Options

* time
    * *Syntax:* now | updated | created | resolved
    * *Description:* By default, _time is set to the current timestamp (now), but if you'd like to have _time reflect one of the native timefields on the issue, you can choose from updated, created, or resolved (if this field is empty, _time will be set to the unix epoch - January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT)

#### Notes

jirasoap is a 'generating' command that produces a results table. It does not create events. There is also a prototype retainsevents version called 'jirasoapevents' with the same syntax.
It creates real events instead of a table, but the events are empty so far...

### jiraxml (SearchRequest XML - deprecated)

#### Synopsis

Send a JQL query, return a table with one row for each result

#### Syntax

```
| jira [time=TIME_OPTION] [JQL_QUERY]
```

#### Arguments

* time
    * *Syntax:* now | updated | created | resolved
    * *Description:* By default, _time is set to the current timestamp (now), but if you'd like to have _time reflect one of the native timefields on the issue, you can choose from updated, created, or resolved (if this field is empty, _time will be set to the unix epoch - January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT)
* JQL_QUERY
    * If omitted, search for all Issues in the default project

#### Notes

jiraxml is a 'generating' command that produces a results table. It does not create events. There is also a prototype retainsevents version called 'jiraxmlevents' with the same syntax.
It creates real events instead of a table, but the events are empty so far...

## Deployment

1. Place the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/jira
2. Create a folder named local, copy default/jira.conf into local, and update with configuration specific to your instance.
3. Copy config.ini.sample from default/config.ini.sample to local/config.ini and update with your authentication credentials

Configure which keys to display in the table with the keys, time_keys, and custom_keys fields.

* Note that the SOAP API command ignores the key configuration.
